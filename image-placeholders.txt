### Image Placeholders for Jalal's Website

To complete the website, please create or source the following images:

1. jalal-profile.jpg
   - Description: Professional headshot or portrait of Muhammad Jalal Wajid
   - Used in: Home page (index.html)
   - Size: Square, approximately 800x800px

2. jalal-about.jpg 
   - Description: Professional image of Jalal in a business setting
   - Used in: About page (about.html)
   - Size: Landscape or portrait, approximately 800x1000px

Note: Add these images to the /Jalal/assets/ directory to complete the website. The website is designed to work with these specific image filenames.

For testing purposes, you can use placeholder images by:
1. Using stock photos (ensuring proper licensing)
2. Using placeholder services like https://placehold.co/ 
3. Creating solid color blocks with the person's initials

Example:
- For jalal-profile.jpg: https://placehold.co/800x800/1e88e5/ffffff?text=MJW
- For jalal-about.jpg: https://placehold.co/800x1000/1e88e5/ffffff?text=MJW

Once the actual images are available, simply replace these placeholder files while keeping the filenames the same.
